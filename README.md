# PolyMarket Simulation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It simulates a real-time prediction market where users can trade on various market questions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features

- **Real-time Trading Simulation**: Users can place buy and sell orders on various market questions.
- **Market Questions**: Users can trade on questions like "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by the end of 2024?" and "Will SpaceX land humans on Mars by 2030?"
- **Order Matching**: The application includes a simple order matching engine that processes trades based on user orders.
- **Market Price Updates**: Prices for each market are updated based on the order book and recent trades.
- **User Management**: The simulation generates mock users with random balances and avatars.
